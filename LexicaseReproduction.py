#1 Population.py evaluates all the genomes fitness and puts them into species with the speciate function. 
#The speciate function can be found in the species folder. The first step that needs to be taken is to gut 
#the speciate function. Make sure that all genomes are in one species called Population. 

#2The create new function creates the initial population. This function is called in the population folder
#and shortly after in lines 41-46 the intial population is split up into species. Make sure that when you 
#update the species file it doesn't impact the first generation. 

#3Create a function that will implement epsilon lexicase and will put all into one population. 


##REMINDER: you referrence the test case errors with genome.lexicase[Testcase] or self.lexicase[TestCase]
